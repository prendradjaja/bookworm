## 2/17: DRY? What's that?

**v0.1.0:** Forked my
[Friendlog](https://github.com/prendradjaja/friendlog-web) project and
basically just search-and-replaced to turn it into a reading tracker. It
feels a little silly because there's so much duplicate code (and parallel
changes I'll be making in both), but I think while there is a lot in common
in these project now, they'll end up diverging and it doesn't really make
sense to abstract (make reusable) much of any of this stuff.

**v0.1.1:** Oops, I didn't update the "New Entry" link.

**v0.1.2:** Color-coded book titles! This is pretty ugly, but functional for
now.

I also now have easier deploys with `deploy.sh`!

**v0.1.3:** Changed colors to be more distinguishable from Friendlog.

**v0.1.4:** Small tweak: Moved page numbers to same row as book title. (Easier
deploys encourage me to make small tweaks!)

**v0.1.5:** Added some AWFUL caching that comes with some new tech debt:

- [ ] Use Observable instead of this silly get/getCached thing
- [ ] \(Probably will get handled when I do the above) Dedupe repeated code in get/getCached etc

## 3/7

**v0.1.6:** Added FAB -- and it's smart, it guesses which book you want!

- When not filtering, use the first book
- When filtering, use the book you're filtering by (which, of course, will also be the first book)

**v0.1.7:** Add GitHub link

## 3/9-15

**v0.1.8:**

- Favicon
- Calendar view

## 3/15

**v0.1.9:**

- Calendar: Two colors in one day!
- Calendar: End-of-book marker (p ugly rn but w/e)

**v0.1.10:** End-of-book marker style

**v0.1.11:** Color service

## 3/18-24

**v0.1.12:**

- Line break support (both paragraphs and newlines, unlike Friendlog)
- Fix z-index bug for multi-book days
- Changing filter removes "active calendar day" styling
    - I wonder why I then had to do `.toString()` comparison in the <calendar-view> template instead of `===` like before. Or why didn't `==` work? Check 7e3d8ab
- Prefill "Other"
    - there's no easy way to tell if it's an "Other" or not, and it doesn't really matter if I just assume everything's an Other, so I did that.
- Placeholder for 3+ colors

## 3/24

- Learned: For Services and other `@Injectable`s, initialization happens in ctor not oninit https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35110690/ngoninit-not-being-called-when-injectable-class-is-instantiated
- Tried using a color palette instead of hash colors, but my color palette was ugly and I still don't know how I would deal with collisions (maybe manual reassignment, just like with hashing?). I have some almost-usable code if I ever want to come up with a better color palette, though.

**v0.1.13:**

- Left border
- Manually reassign color for title "The Gamer" -- too close to "Norse Mythology"

**v0.1.14:** Custom colors!

## 3/25

**v0.1.15:** Top color (for 2-book days) is the first book

## 3/27

**v0.1.16:** Fix directory structure

**v0.1.17:**

- (development only) offlineOnly mode
- Fix fab z-index

## 3/29

**v0.1.18:** Redo topnav:

- Add link to responses sheet
- Don't show "Loading..." when offline
- Everything in one line

**v0.1.19:**

- Don't scroll to top (todo: fix other places)
- Max-width 400
- Center calendar

## 3/29-4/6

**v0.1.20:**

- jk don't center
- (not user-visible) some cleanup (makeDay)
- keyboard shortcut "c" for creating new event

## 4/10

**NEXT:**

Bugfix: Long URL would cause FAB to be hidden...

...since it's in the bottom right corner and the long URL causes the
document(?) to become bigger. Strangely this is only an issue on mobile.

In any case, overflow: hidden fixes it.
